# Flutter + Android + Nix Flake Template

This is a Nix Flake setup for Flutter development with Android support.  
It is designed to simplify your development environment while giving you more control over SDK versions and system dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Minimal downloads: If you already have the Android SDK installed on your system, there's no need to download large files again.
- Version control: You can manage NDK and other component versions directly via Android Studio.
- `.envrc` support using [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) for automatic environment loading.
- Works well with VSCode and Android emulators (with a small manual step â€” see below).

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) installe
- flake
- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) installed and enabled for your shell
- Android SDK installed manually on your system (e.g., via Android Studio)

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use

1. **Create a new project using this template**:

   ```bash
   nix flake new my_flutter_app -t github:Amir-Hossein-Azimi/flutter_nix_config
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
    
    ```bash
    cd my_flutter_app
    ```
    
3. **Build the development shell**:
    
    ```bash
    nix build .#devShells.x86_64-linux.default
    ```
    
4. **Enter the development environment**:
    
    ```bash
    nix develop .
    ```
    
5. **Allow the environment with direnv** (optional but recommended):
    
    ```bash
    direnv allow
    ```
    
    > Make sure you have `direnv` installed and enabled.

 6. **Initialize a new Flutter project (if needed)**:

     Inside your development shell, you can run:

     ```bash
      flutter create .
     ```

This sets up a standard Flutter app in the current directory.
    
7. **Open the project in VSCode or your preferred editor.**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Tip: Free Up RAM After Emulator Use

If you notice that even after closing the emulator your system RAM is still heavily used â€”  
and `htop` shows that `openjdk17` or Gradle processes are still running â€”  
you can free up memory by stopping the lingering Gradle daemons:


```bash
pkill -f 'org.gradle.launcher.daemon.bootstrap.GradleDaemon'
```

This is especially useful after emulator use, where Gradle daemons may keep consuming resources in the background.

## ðŸ“‚ Git Ignore Recommendation

To avoid committing local environment files, add the following to your `.gitignore`:

```
/.direnv/
/**/IGNORE/
```

## âš  Emulator Notes

To run the Android emulator, **you need to manually start it via Android Studio**.
Once it's running, VSCode will be able to detect it.

> If you know a better way to make the emulator work automatically with VSCode, feel free to open an issue or suggest improvements â€” contributions are always welcome!
