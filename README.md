# Flutter + Android + Nix Flake Template

This is a Nix Flake setup for Flutter development with Android support.  
It is designed to simplify your development environment while giving you more control over SDK versions and system dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Minimal downloads: If you already have the Android SDK installed on your system, there's no need to download large files again.
- Version control: You can manage NDK and other component versions directly via Android Studio.
- `.envrc` support using [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) for automatic environment loading.
- Works well with VSCode and Android emulators (with a small manual step â€” see below).

## âš  Emulator Notes

To run the Android emulator, **you need to manually start it via Android Studio**.
Once it's running, VSCode will be able to detect it.
